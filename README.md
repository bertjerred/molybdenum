a simple MIDI-controlled music app

## details
This app runs HTML/JS in its own browser, allowing users to connect a MIDI device
and play notes. I began with four simple oscillators and eventually added a few
hard-coded refinements: a subtle ADSR envelope and "Biquad filter" LFO.
These are ripe for improvements or for breaking out into the UI.

There is plenty of console logging going on, too (CTRL+SHIFT+I).
I designed this app as an exercise in learning about Electron.
Overall, this is meant for basic sound-making on low-end devices.
